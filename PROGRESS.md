# Implementation progress and handoff

Updated: 2026-09-17 · Branch: `codex/uste-implementation`

## Completed this increment

- Recorded owner-authorized Decision 0011, separating local development governance (T-06)
  from operational private-reporting verification (new T-62) without claiming verification.
- Corrected reporting participation to include the reporter and authorized repository security/
  triage participants, rather than the inaccurate maintainer-only description.
- Closed T-06/T-07 and R0 at the development decision/evidence scope after aligning stale
  pre-decision specification text and rerunning its actual prerequisites.
- Added a task-graph check proving the 62-task graph is acyclic, T-08 does not inherit T-62,
  and R4 decision T-44 does inherit T-62. R2/R3 are explicitly local readiness gates and no
  executable distribution is allowed while T-62 is open.
- Completed T-08 with a Rust 1.95.0/resolver-3 workspace, initial safe-Rust `uste-types` crate,
  root lockfile, read-only CI, active-document/reference validation and reproducible quality/
  supply-chain scripts. Excluded experiment workspaces retain their independent pinned locks.
- Completed T-09 with Decision 0012, bounded generic values, typed/scoped identities, UTC
  instants, nonzero monotonic commit revisions and a strict canonical format-1.0 codec.
- Added independent literal R1 goldens for all assigned value tags and numeric/time/reference
  endpoints; malformed length/integer/version/tag/order/UTF-8/depth inputs fail closed.
- Added a fixed 262,144-node aggregate budget and fallible decode allocation after review found
  that per-container/wire limits alone permitted heap amplification. Adversarial nested input now
  rejects before the violating container reserves its declared children.
- Added isolated pinned `cargo-fuzz` targets for arbitrary malformed frames and generated valid
  trees, a reproducible runner and bounded CI smoke campaigns. The native fuzz runtime remains a
  test-only graph outside the safe-Rust product workspace.
- Read the complete current requirement set, both accepted product decisions and every
  current domain specification. No applicable USTE `AGENTS.md` exists.
- Preserved the clean starting worktree and created the requested branch from `be5f7a4`.
- Added Decisions 0003–0010 covering the v1 data/time, storage, cryptography/retention,
  content-worker, benchmark/limit, governance, spatial and physics profiles.
- Added literal R0 acceptance vectors and a safe-Rust standalone vector test.
- Added a storage-publication model that exhaustively tests every record cut and byte
  corruption for the proposed commit frontier.
- Resolved and compiled the pinned strict-profile dependency candidates; recorded a lockfile,
  native-link/license feasibility and the remaining unsafe/advisory review scope.
- Added the `synthetic-v1` Rust fixture-generator kernel with strict seed parsing, domain
  separation, bounded-memory emission and a pinned BLAKE3 golden digest.
- Added reproducible Fedora Kinoite/Toolbox setup and runnable synthetic commands.
- Added a committed dependency policy and ran cargo-deny 0.20.2: zero advisory, license or
  source errors; one documented duplicate-version warning in the combined parser graph.
- Materialized 19 deterministic JSON/PDF/OOXML/archive/image/audio/video fixtures with pinned
  byte counts and SHA-256 values; positive formats and hostile archive metadata are smoke-tested.
- Classified direct cryptographic/parser unsafe boundaries and selected-feature reachability;
  kept JPEG SIMD disabled and parser unsafe outside the privileged engine boundary.
- Verified unprivileged bubblewrap mount/network/user/PID isolation and in-worker address-space,
  CPU-time and descriptor limits on the reference runner; recorded cgroup/seccomp gaps.
- Completed the R0 cross-decision audit, corrected BM-04 from an inadmissible 20 GiB blob to
  a 12 GiB within-cap stream, and checked T-01–T-05/T-46–T-47 with linked evidence.
- Recorded the exact external distribution blocker without claiming disclosure verification or
  any implementation/release gate.

Reference runner observed: Fedora 44, kernel 7.1.10, Btrfs 7.1/local NVMe, Intel i9-13900KF,
64 GiB RAM, Rust/Cargo 1.95.0. Pinned lockfiles now pass cargo-deny advisory/license/source
policy checks; no benchmark measurement exists yet.

## Limitations and external prerequisites

- T-62 requires the repository owner/administrator to enable and harmlessly test GitHub private
  vulnerability reporting. The previously observed GitHub CLI token is invalid and was not
  retried; SSH Git access is not administrative access. This blocks executable distribution and
  T-44, but it does not block local implementation, integration or artifact preparation.
- R0 decisions do not provide implementation, achieved benchmark performance or production
  security evidence. Transitive unsafe validation, the T-23 supervisor and actual BM results
  remain later-gate work.
- The canonical type/codec kernel is implemented, but there is still no database executable,
  transaction coordinator, durable storage, encryption or production qualification. The fuzz
  runner requires nightly Rust plus a C++ compiler, both confined to development tooling.

## Next dependency-permitted work

Implement T-10's independent in-memory reference model. T-11's encryption/key boundary and
T-12's deterministic I/O fault harness are also unblocked by T-09 and can proceed as independent
work packages. T-62 remains independent and must not be represented as complete without
owner-administered evidence.
